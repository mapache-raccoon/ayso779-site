            Team Roles & Expectations
          </h2>

          <div class="role">
            <h3>Team Name Selection</h3>
            <p>
              Choose a fun, creative team name that isn’t tied to jersey color.
              This avoids confusion on game days and gives the kids something
              unique to rally around.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="role">
            <h3>Assistant Coach</h3>
            <p>
              Each team is encouraged to have at least one assistant coach.
              Assistants complete the same certifications as the head coach to
              ensure consistency, safety, and support during practices and
              games.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="role">
            <h3>Referee Support</h3>
            <p>
              Each team should identify 1&ndash;2 volunteers who can complete
              the 8U Referee certification or higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a huge help to the coach—teams referee their own games, so
              having trained parents or older siblings (12+) ready to step in
              keeps things running smoothly and lets the coach focus on the
              players.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="role">
            <h3>Field Setup &amp; Tear‑Down</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>First game of the day:</strong> Arrive one hour early to
                help with field setup (goals, cones, lines, etc.).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Last game of the day:</strong> Assist with full field
                tear‑down and equipment return.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There is no group after you, so the final team of the day is
              responsible for leaving their field completely cleared.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="role">
            <h3>Snack Coordinator</h3>
            <p>
              The team parent organizes the snack schedule for halftime and
              post‑game treats. A simple rotation works well. Be sure to check
              for allergies or dietary restrictions before the first game.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="role">
            <h3>Team Parties &amp; End‑of‑Season Celebration</h3>
            <p>
              Many teams enjoy hosting a mid‑season get‑together or an
              end‑of‑season celebration. Options can be simple and low‑stress,
              such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A park meetup after the final game</li>
              <li>A pizza party</li>
              <li>A potluck or dessert party</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The team parent typically coordinates dates, locations, and
              contributions so everyone feels included and the kids get a fun
              memory to wrap up the season.
