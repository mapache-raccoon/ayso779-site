          <p>
            AYSO coaching is built for everyday people -
            <strong>NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED</strong> - because our Region gives you
            all the training, tools, and support to grow into an amazing coach.
            You won’t be alone at any point; from age-appropriate AYSO courses
            to on-field guidance and a community of volunteers, we walk with you
            every step of the journey. Coaching becomes a chance to bond with
            your child, create joyful memories, and help kids develop
            confidence, teamwork, and a love of the game. AYSO’s nationally
            recognized training is designed specifically for volunteers with
            little or no soccer background, so if you bring enthusiasm and a
            willingness to learn, we can turn you into a certified, capable
            coach who truly brings out the best in kids.

              <h3>Coach Conduct</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>POSITIVE COACHING</strong> - Bring encouragement,
                  patience, and praise to every player. Help them grow, try new
                  things, and feel proud of their effort.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>BE PREPARED &amp; ORGANIZED</strong> - Have a plan for
                  each practice, bring the right equipment, and keep rosters and
                  registration forms handy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>POSITIVE SIDELINE CONDUCT</strong> - Set the tone.
                  Keep comments supportive, stay calm, and model the behavior we
                  want our players and parents to follow.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>RESPECT THE REFEREES</strong> - Our refs—youth and
                  adult—deserve kindness and support. Their calls stand. We
                  teach our players to play on, not argue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY</strong> - No yelling at refs,
                  no negative comments toward players, coaches, or parents. We
                  protect the fun and safety of the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>GOOD COMMUNICATION</strong> - Keep parents and your
                  division coordinator in the loop about schedules, changes, and
                  expectations. Clear communication makes the season smoother
                  for everyone.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>EXPECTATIONS FOR YOU, PLAYERS &amp; PARENTS</strong> -
                  Set simple, shared expectations early: effort, respect,
                  teamwork, and positivity from all sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>ALWAYS HAVE PLAYER FORMS</strong> - Bring player
                  registration and emergency forms to every practice and game.
                  Safety first.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>GET YOUR PARENTS INVOLVED</strong> - Ask for help!
                  Team parents, snack schedules, field setup, cleanup—AYSO works
                  best when everyone pitches in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>REMEMBER: THE KIDS ARE HERE TO HAVE FUN!</strong> -
                  Winning is optional. Joy, confidence, friendships, and a love
                  for the game are the real goals.
                </li>
