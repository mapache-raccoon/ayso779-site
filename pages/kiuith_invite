      <section>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>
          This year we will attempt to create multiple flights based on each
          team’s record in the U10 and U12 divisions. Our intent will be to
          balance flights to ensure play is balanced for all teams (based on
          applications received). Play will consist of a minimum of three
          scheduled games in a round-robin “pool play” format.
        </p>
        <p>
          All pool games will be as follows: (70 min. for U-19, 70 min. U-16, 60
          min. for U-14, 50 min for U-12, and 40 min for U-10)
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a divisional flight with 8 Teams, Pool Winners will advance.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a Division with a 6 team flight, cross pool play will be used and
            the top 2 teams in overall points will advance.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a Division with a 5 team flight, each team will play all others
            once, with the top 2 advancing to a Championship (or to be based on
            points).
          </li>
          <li>
            In a Division with a 4 team flight, each team will play all others
            once, with the first and second place teams to be determined by
            final standings in points.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
          The disposition of net profits from the 2026 Tournament will be used
          to help fund the Chino Hills AYSO Spring Program and to cover spring
          expenses (fields, lights, etc.) and to help reimburse our teams with a
          portion of their spring tournaments and area fees.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Awards</h2>
        <p>
          Medals will be presented to coaches and players for first and second
          place teams in each division. A tournament pin and T-shirt will be
          presented to each player and coach.
        </p>
