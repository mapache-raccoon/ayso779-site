            Referees are essential to the AYSO experience — and you don’t need
            prior soccer experience to get started. AYSO provides all the
            training you need, and many volunteers discover that refereeing is
            one of the most fun, rewarding ways to support their child and the
            community. Whether you’re a parent, a teen volunteer, or a returning
            referee, you’ll make a real impact every time you step on the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Referees help create a safe, fair, and positive environment where
            kids can grow, build confidence, and fall in love with the game.
            You’re supporting players, staying close to the action, and helping
            shape the kind of soccer experience that keeps kids coming back
            season after season.

          <p>
            Referees are at the heart of every AYSO game. We simply can’t play
            without them — but beyond necessity, the role is genuinely
            meaningful. You’re the steady presence who helps ensure that every
            match is safe, respectful, and development‑focused.

          <h2 class="section__title">Why Become an AYSO Referee?</h2>

          <h3>We Need You</h3>
          <p>
            Every game requires a referee. When parents and community members
            step into this role, it keeps our program running smoothly and
            ensures every team gets the chance to play.
          </p>

          <h3>It’s Fun and Incredibly Rewarding</h3>
          <p>
            Working with kids, watching them grow, and being part of their
            soccer journey is one of the best parts of volunteering. Many
            referees find they enjoy it even more than they expected.
          </p>

          <h3>You’re the Guardian of the Game</h3>
          <p>
            Referees are the independent officials who manage the match. Your
            authority extends to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Players</li>
            <li>Substitutes</li>
            <li>Coaches and team officials</li>
            <li>Spectators</li>
            <li>Assistant referees</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your presence helps maintain a positive, respectful environment
            where kids can focus on playing and learning.
          </p>

          <h3>Safety Comes First</h3>
          <p>
            The referee’s top priority is player safety. While all sports carry
            some risk, referees help minimize it by monitoring:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Field conditions</li>
            <li>Equipment</li>
            <li>Player behavior</li>
            <li>Spectator conduct</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A safe game is a fun game — and kids stay in the sport longer when
            they feel protected and supported.
          </p>

          <h3>Fairness and Flow</h3>
          <p>Referees enforce the Laws of the Game in a way that keeps play:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Safe</li>
            <li>Fair</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Good referees interfere as little as possible, calling only what
            they clearly see and avoiding “doubtful or trifling” offenses. This
            helps the game flow and keeps the focus on the players.
          </p>

          <h3>Understanding What “Fun” Looks Like</h3>
          <p>
            Fun looks different at each age group. Referees learn how to adjust
            their approach so the game stays development‑appropriate — from the
            joyful chaos of 6U to the more structured play of older divisions.

          </h2>
          <h3>Is there an age requirement?</h3>
