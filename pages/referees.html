          <p>
            Referees are essential to our community and to every match. You do
            not need prior experience to get started. Families and community
            members learn the skills as they go, and by volunteering to referee
            you help create a safe, fair, and positive soccer environment for
            every child. Spring Open is the perfect time to jump in because the
            games are smaller, the pace is easier, and the atmosphere is
            relaxed. It is a fun way to get a feel for the role and a great
            chance to get ahead if you plan to referee in the fall.

              <h3>We Need You</h3>
              <p>
                Every match needs an adult or youth official to keep play
                running smoothly. When parents and local volunteers referee they
                enable children to play, learn, and enjoy the game.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>It Is Fun and Rewarding</h3>
              <p>
                Refereeing is a great way to spend time outside, stay involved
                with your child and make new friends. Many volunteers find it
                fun and rewarding to support players and teams from the center
                of the field.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>You Are the Guardian of the Game</h3>
              <p>
                As the match official you set the tone for respect and
                sportsmanship. Players coaches and families look to you to
                manage the game with calm and confidence.
              </p>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Safety Comes First</h3>
              <p>
                Referees watch for unsafe equipment dangerous conditions and
                injured players. Your attention helps keep children healthy and
                ensures prompt care when it is needed.

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Fairness and Flow</h3>
              <p>
                Good officiating keeps the game fair and flowing. You make clear
                calls that let the teams play step in when rules matter and
                manage restarts so the match moves at the right pace.
              </p>

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Understanding What Fun Looks Like</h3>
              <p>
                Fun is different at each age group. Referees learn how to adjust
                their approach so the game stays development appropriate and
                enjoyable for the players.

                    <strong>Touch lines</strong> – The lines that form the long
                    side of the field where players may “touch” the ball for a
                    throw-in. Not “sideline” as in some other sports.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Goal lines</strong> – The lines at the ends of the

                    other sports.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Handling the ball</strong> – A player’s deliberate
                    use of his/her hands to control the ball. Not “handball”,
                    which is another sport that uses a small hard ball and a
                    wall.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Goal area</strong> – The area defined for taking
                    goal kicks in front of the goals. Not “goal box”, which
                    implies a three-dimensional structure.

                  <li>
                    <strong>Penalty area</strong> – The area defined where
                    goalkeepers may use their hands and where certain fouls
                    result in a penalty kick. Not “penalty box” or “the box”,
                    which imply a three-dimensional structure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Goalkeeper</strong> – The player allowed to use
                    his/her hands inside the penalty area to control the ball.
                    Not “goalie”, which is a name used in other sports. “Keeper”
                    is an acceptable shortening.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Good ball!</strong> – A compliment to a teammate for
                    a ball well played. Not “good kick”, which parents yell for
                    any strong kick no matter where the ball goes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Man On!</strong> – Telling a teammate there is an
                    approaching opponent who is applying pressure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Clear it!</strong> – A request to a teammate to kick
                    the ball away from the goal.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Push Up!</strong> – A request for defenders to move
