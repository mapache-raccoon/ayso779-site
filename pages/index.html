          <h2 class="section__title">Welcome to Spring Open 2026</h2>
          <p class="welcome-lead">
            Welcome to AYSO 779 Spring Open, a season full of energy,
            creativity, and community spirit. Powered entirely by volunteers,
            Spring Open brings families and neighbors together to create a
            positive environment where kids can explore the game in new ways.
            With smaller teams and plenty of touches, players stay involved from
            start to finish, trying new moves, building confidence, and
            discovering what they can do with the ball. It is a chance for every
            child to grow at their own pace while enjoying the simple fun of
            playing soccer with friends. <br /><br />
            Spring is designed to spark curiosity and encourage players to
            express themselves on the field. We do not keep standings because
            the focus is on learning, teamwork, and joyful competition. Kids
            rotate positions, support one another, and get the freedom to
            experiment without pressure. Everything we do is guided by AYSO’s
            Six Philosophies: Everyone Plays, Balanced Teams, Open Registration,
            Positive Coaching, Good Sportsmanship, and Player Development. These
            principles ensure every child gets meaningful playing time and a
            chance to shine. Spring Open is all about fun, growth, and the joy
            of the game.
